## 🚀 How to Debug:

### Step 1: Test Email Configuration
Open your browser or Postman and visit:
```
http://localhost:5000/api/auth/test-email-config
```

This will show you:
- Is EMAIL_USER set?
- Is EMAIL_PASSWORD set?
- What is FRONTEND_URL?

### Step 2: Check Server Console
When you submit the forgot password form, your server console will show:

```
=== FORGOT PASSWORD REQUEST ===
Request body: { email: 'sahatushankar234@gmail.com' }
Email received: sahatushankar234@gmail.com

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions:

### Issue 1: "Invalid login" or "Username and Password not accepted"
**Cause:** Gmail App Password is incorrect or not set

**Solution:**
1. Go to Google Account → Security
2. Enable 2-Factor Authentication
3. Go to App Passwords
4. Generate a new password for "Mail"
5. Update `.env` file:
   ```
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
   ```
   (use the 16-character password WITHOUT spaces)

### Issue 2: "User not found"
**Cause:** The email address doesn't exist in the database

**Solution:**
1. Check your admin user in MongoDB
2. Make sure the email matches exactly
3. Try logging in first to verify the account exists

### Issue 3: "EMAIL_USER not set" or "EMAIL_PASSWORD not set"
**Cause:** Environment variables are not loaded

**Solution:**
1. Check your `.env` file in the server directory
2. Make sure it has:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
   FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
   ```
3. Restart the server after updating `.env`

### Issue 4: "Connection timeout" or "ETIMEDOUT"
**Cause:** Firewall or network blocking Gmail SMTP

**Solution:**
1. Check if port 587 or 465 is blocked
2. Try using port 465 with secure: true:
   ```javascript
   port: 465,
   secure: true,
   ```
3. Check your antivirus/firewall settings

## 📧 Email Configuration Details:

Current settings in `.env`:
```env
EMAIL_USER=tirtho.kyptronix@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=kozi ozmn wtzn cuyg
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
```

**Note:** The EMAIL_PASSWORD appears to be a Gmail App Password (with spaces).
In the code, it should work with or without spaces, but Gmail expects it without spaces.

## 🧪 Testing Steps:

1. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

2. **Check the console** for startup messages

3. **Visit test endpoint:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000/api/auth/test-email-config
   ```

4. **Try forgot password** with a valid admin email

5. **Watch the server console** for detailed logs

6. **Check your email** (including spam folder)

## 🎯 Next Steps:

1. **Restart your server** to load the debugging code
2. **Try the forgot password feature** again
3. **Copy the full console output** and share it to identify the exact issue
4. **Check the test endpoint** to verify environment variables

The detailed logs will tell us exactly where the email sending is failing!
